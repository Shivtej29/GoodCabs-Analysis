## Project Summary
Goodcabs is a ride-hailing company focused on Tier-2 Indian cities. This analysis was undertaken to:

•	Evaluate trip and passenger trends across cities  
•	Measure performance against business targets  
•	Identify opportunities for operational optimization  
•	Build an interactive dashboard to enable data-driven decisions  

The insights are derived from structured trip and passenger data, benchmark targets, and key KPIs that support strategic growth.

## Data Overview
### Databases & Tables  

• trips_db– Trip & Passenger Data   
• dim_city-	Contains city identifiers and names  
• dim_date-	Calendar-level data: month, day type  
• fact_trips-	Individual trip data: distance, fare, ratings  
• fact_passenger_summary-	Monthly aggregated passenger metrics  
• dim_repeat_trip_distribution-	Trip frequency by repeat passengers  
• targets_db- Monthly Performance Targets  
• monthly_target_trips- Total trip volume targets  
• monthly_target_new_passengers	City- wise monthly new user acquisition targets  
• city_target_passenger_rating- Desired average passenger ratings  

## Business Questions
The project aimed to answer the following:
1.	Which cities are underperforming in terms of trip volume?
2.	What is the repeat rate across cities?
3.	Are average passenger ratings meeting targets?
4.	What is the relationship between fare and service quality?
5.	Which cities have the highest customer retention?   
6. How do weekday vs. weekend trends vary?  
7. What is the average trip distance and revenue per kilometre?  
8. How does repeat behaviour change monthly?  

## Key Metrics

## Weekday vs. Weekend Travel  
•	Weekday Dominant Cities: Jaipur, Surat  
•	Balanced Cities: Indore, Vadodara  

This data helps in targeting promotions on specific days.
		
## Performance Against Targets: [Target Metric,	Target,	Actual	Variance]  
•	New Passengers ->	185.1K,	177.0K	-4.38%  
•	Total Trips ->	429.0K,	425.9K,	-0.72%  
•	Average Passenger Rating ->	7.98,	7.66,	-3.94%  

## Performance vs. Targets
#### Trip Targets  
•	Slight shortfall of ~3K trips overall  
•	Notable gaps in Lucknow, Coimbatore, Mysore  

#### New Passenger Targets  
•	Short by ~8.1K new passengers  
•	Mysore and Jaipur lag behind  

#### Average Passenger Ratings  
•	Target: 7.98 | Actual: 7.66  
•	Cities like Kochi (6.6) and Mysore (6.5) pulling down the average  

## Insights & Recommendations  
### What's Working:  
•	High trip volume in Jaipur, Lucknow, Surat  
•	High revenue-per-trip in Jaipur and Kochi (₹483.92+)  
•	Positive monthly growth in March and May

### What Needs Attention:  
•	Low repeat rates in Jaipur and Mysore – retention strategies needed   
•	APR gap suggests a need for service quality improvements (especially Kochi, Mysore)  
•	Weekend demand is higher in several cities – opportunity for targeted promotions  

### Recommendations  
1.	Improve retention in low RPR cities with loyalty programs.  
2.	Boost customer experience in cities with low ratings using targeted driver training and support.  
3.	Explore price optimization based on AFP and trip distance insights.  
4.	Capitalize on high weekend traffic through weekend-specific incentives or ride packs.  
5.	Push new customer acquisition through city-specific campaigns, especially in Mysore and Jaipur.  

## Conclusion  
Goodcabs is performing near targets in terms of trips and revenue but falls short in user satisfaction and new user growth. Targeted regional interventions can help close these gaps.
